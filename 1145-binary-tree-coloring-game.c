/**
 * Two players play a turn based game on a binary tree.  We are given the root of this binary tree, and the number of
 * nodes n in the tree.  n is odd, and each node has a distinct value from 1 to n.
 * 
 * Initially, the first player names a value x with 1 <= x <= n, and the second player names a value y with 1 <= y <= n
 * and y != x.  The first player colors the node with value x red, and the second player colors the node with value y
 * blue.
 * 
 * Then, the players take turns starting with the first player.  In each turn, that player chooses a node of their
 * color (red if player 1, blue if player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor of the chosen node (either the left
 * child, right child, or parent of the chosen node.)
 * 
 * If (and only if) a player cannot choose such a node in this way, they must pass their turn.  If both players pass
 * their turn, the game ends, and the winner is the player that colored more nodes.
 * 
 * You are the second player.  If it is possible to choose such a y to ensure you win the game, return true.  If it
 * is not possible, return false.
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * root is the root of a binary tree with n nodes and distinct node values from 1 to n.
 * n is odd.
 * 1 <= x <= nÂ <= 100
