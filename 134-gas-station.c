/**
 * There are N gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station i is gas[i].
 * 
 * You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs cost[i] of gas to travel from station i to its next station (i+1).
 * You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.
 * 
 * Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise
 * return -1.
 * 
 * Note:
 * If there exists aÂ solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
 * Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
 * Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.
